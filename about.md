## About Aera

#### Project:
This is a book writing collaboration.
Since i never wrote a book before and english isn't my mother language
and i wanted to get into using github and i don't really have the time
to write a book on my own.
I thought i just post everything i write online.
To find a team that wants to contribute to my work.

#### Workflow
1. I will summorize what will happen in the book from start to finish
1. I will summorize what will happen chapter by chapter
1. Then i will try to write each chapter down using markdown  
1. When you find mistakes or you have a better idea or you want to  write a chapter. You can create a fork and ask for a pull request.
